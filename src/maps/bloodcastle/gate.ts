/**
 * The Blood Castle gate's state, shared by the gate (type 36) and its two
 * debris halves (9/10). This is `g_iActionObjectType / g_iActionTime /
 * g_fActionObjectVelocity` (ZzzObject.cpp:50-58) narrowed to the one object
 * that uses them on this map.
 *
 * Driven by: `BloodCastleGateObject.Update` (the tick) and two triggers -
 *  - the match state `BloodCastleGateDestroyed` (the `BloodCastleState`
 *    packet, read through `events/bloodCastle`), which is the animated fall:
 *    `SetActionObject(world, 36, 20, 1)` - twenty ticks, pitch from 35° up to
 *    90° at a velocity that grows 1.5°/tick, a smoke burst as it passes 80°,
 *    `SOUND_DOWN_GATE` on the first tick (ZzzObject.cpp:96-131);
 *  - the server clearing `TW_NOGROUND` on the pit (`ReceiveSetAttribute`,
 *    WSclient.cpp:8333: `SetActionObject(world, 36, 0, 1)`), which is the
 *    instant version: gate hidden, pit open, debris shown.
 * Read by: the three object classes in this folder.
