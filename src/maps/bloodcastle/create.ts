/**
 * Blood Castle (`WD_11BLOODCASTLE1` … `_END` and the master-level 52 - eight
 * server instances on one art set, `World12` + `Object12`; see
 * `common/worldAssets.ts`).
 *
 * What the original does per object here, and where each piece went:
 *  - 11 candelabra / 13 lamps: bone-anchored light sprites on a sine
 *    (`RenderObjectVisual`, ZzzObject.cpp:3157-3188) - the two classes.
 *  - 36 the gate, 9/10 its debris: `ActionObject` (ZzzObject.cpp:60-140) -
 *    `gate.ts` + `gateObject.ts`. The fall opens the `TW_NOGROUND` pit under
 *    the gate through `world.setTerrainFlags`, which is also what the server's
 *    `ChangeTerrainAttributes` packet drives (libs/mu/terrainAttributeUpdates).
 *  - 37 smoke vents: `spec.ts` emissions.
 *  - 28/29 (`RenderObject`, ZzzObject.cpp:1041-1057): two statue types drawn
 *    normally and then *again* as a flat black shadow with `HiddenMesh = 2`.
 *    **Not reproduced** - the blob shadow every map object already gets is
 *    the same idea, and a second projected copy of a 4-mesh statue is not
 *    worth a render path of its own.
 *  - The hero's flare motes (`MoveObjectOnEffect`'s `InBloodCastle` branch,
 *    ZzzObject.cpp:4315-4330: a `BITMAP_FLARE` every fourth tick in a 9x9 tile
 *    box around the player, 2.5-3 tiles up). **Not reproduced**: it is a
 *    hero-relative ambient like Icarus's sparkle, and the weather system's
 *    sky particles are the place for it once a "motes" recipe exists.
 *
 * The bridge: `deathSystem` already reads the `TW_ACTION` rails at x 13/15
 * (y 16-21) and the pit's `TW_NOGROUND` to pick the fall animation
 * (WSclient.cpp:5440-5487); both flags are in EncTerrain12.att as shipped,
 * so nothing here has to set them.
 *
 * Sound: `iBloodCastle` loops from match state 0 (ambientBeds.ts); no music.
 * Mood: none registered - `MOOD_BY_WORLD` has no row, so the map runs on the
 * default grade plus its own baked lightmap, which is red-brown by design.
